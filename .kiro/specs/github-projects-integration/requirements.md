# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically fetch and display projects from the user's GitHub profile on their portfolio website. Instead of manually maintaining a list of projects, the website will dynamically pull repository information from GitHub's API, including project descriptions, technologies used, stars, and links. This ensures the portfolio stays up-to-date with the latest projects without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio website visitor, I want to see the developer's latest GitHub projects automatically displayed, so that I can view their most current work without the developer having to manually update the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the projects section loads THEN the system SHALL fetch repository data from GitHub API
2. WHEN repository data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display project cards with repository information
3. WHEN the GitHub API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message or cached data
4. WHEN a project card is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the GitHub repository in a new tab

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio website owner, I want to configure which repositories are displayed, so that I can control which projects appear on my portfolio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the GitHub integration THEN the system SHALL allow filtering repositories by criteria (public/private, stars, topics, etc.)
2. WHEN a repository is archived THEN the system SHALL optionally exclude it from display based on configuration
3. WHEN a repository has specific topics/tags THEN the system SHALL allow filtering based on those topics
4. WHEN repositories are fetched THEN the system SHALL sort them by a configurable criteria (stars, updated date, created date)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio website visitor, I want to see relevant project information at a glance, so that I can quickly understand what each project does and what technologies were used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a project card THEN the system SHALL show repository name, description, and primary language
2. WHEN repository has topics/tags THEN the system SHALL display them as technology badges
3. WHEN repository has star count THEN the system SHALL display the star count
4. WHEN repository was recently updated THEN the system SHALL show the last updated date
5. WHEN repository has a homepage URL THEN the system SHALL provide a link to the live demo

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio website owner, I want the GitHub integration to be performant and not slow down my site, so that visitors have a good browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fetching GitHub data THEN the system SHALL implement caching to avoid excessive API calls
2. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL show loading states while fetching data
3. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data is cached THEN the system SHALL refresh cache after a reasonable time interval

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio website visitor, I want the projects section to look professional and match the site's design, so that the experience feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying project cards THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the existing website theme
2. WHEN projects are loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loaders or loading indicators
3. WHEN displaying multiple projects THEN the system SHALL arrange them in a responsive grid layout
4. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display projects in a mobile-friendly format
5. WHEN hovering over project cards THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
